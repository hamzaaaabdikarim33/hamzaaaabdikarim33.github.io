                                        I was born in Fargo, North Dakota but raised in the twin cities area and I love it here. I spent a couple yeears living in Kenya to spend time with my family who lives there, and that was awesome, I had alot of fun getting to see a whole diffrent culture and make new freinds. I also love to play sports, Baketball and football are my favorite sports I played both sports in high school and I'm also a huge sports junkie when it comes to watching and keeping up with sports  
                                       </p>
